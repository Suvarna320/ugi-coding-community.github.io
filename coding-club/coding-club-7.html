                            <strong>Round 1:</strong><br> Online Coding Round First round is an online programming round with 2 questions.<br><br>

1. Given an array of elements and change the array in such a way that all the elements on the array are distinct. if you are replacing a value, then the replacing value should be great than the previous value and after modification sum of the elements should be as less as possible.<br> Example: arr[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5] and the result should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  example 2 [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7] then the result should be [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10] or 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 9]<br><br>

2. The second question is similar to LCS with a slight modification. that is Find a longest common subsequence that all the characters present in the subsequence should be of vowels.<br>

Example : input abcef, ffiocd then the answer should be 3 (abc, ioc)<br><br>


                            <strong>Round 2:</strong> <br>
Face to Face interview: Basically, they are hiring only for the Java developers. and their further rounds will be on Java only. But in my case I don’t have much experience with Java. so mine was based on data structures and algorithms.<br>

1. First question in on the implementation of LRU cache.<br>
2. Second one is on rotating the matrix 90 degree.<br><br>


                            <strong>Round 3:</strong><br>
Face to Face interview 2:<br> 
1.  Find the missing and repeating elements on the array. the output should also include the number of times the repeating elements occur.<br> 
2. Second is a stock span problem.<br>

                        <p>We often get this question from coders<br><br>
                            <strong>“What are some really interesting machine learning projects for beginners?”</strong><br><br>

It is always helpful to gain insights on how real people are beginning their career in machine learning. In this post, you will find out how beginners like you can make a great progress in applying machine learning to real-world problems with these fantastic machine learning projects for beginners recommended by industry experts.<br> 

The Process Behind Beginning to Work on a Machine Learning Project<br>
You want to start working on a machine learning project-but what processes do you need to remember and how you will manage the data are the two crucial stages to begin working on any machine learning project. Choose a dataset and understand it to decipher as to which machine learning algorithm class or type can address the business problem in the best possible manner.<br>

For machine learning beginners, our experts suggest that they start with a modest sized dataset that has been well studied before by experts. There are multiple libraries of data sources  that have high-quality datasets such as – UCI ML Repository and Kaggle. Your goal before you begin any ML project should be to have an in-depth understanding of the problem that the data represents, the structure of the dataset and what all machine learning algorithms are best suited to solve the problem at hand. When studying the dataset , always use a statistical environment so that your focus remains on the questions you are looking to answer about the dataset instead of being distracted from a given technique and learning how to implement it in code. Some tips and tricks that can be of great help when studying and working with a machine learning dataset –<br>

Have a clear and in-depth understanding of the problem that the dataset represents.<br>
Always summarize the machine learning dataset using descriptive statistics.<br>
Make a note of the structures you observe in the data and put forward all the relationships  observed in the data.<br>
Quickly test a couple of top machine learning algorithms on the dataset and find out which general class of algorithms has a better performance.<br>
Tune the algorithms to identify the algorithm that performs well for a given data problem and tune it accordingly.<br>
