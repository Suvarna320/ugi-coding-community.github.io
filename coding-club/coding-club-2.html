                        <p>if you are a beginner, don’t contribute to an open source project on GitHub! It’s a dead end venture that leads to frustration and anger!<br>

Here are three lessons I learnt the hard way about contributing to GitHub as a beginner.<br>

                            1. <strong>There is no beginner-friendly open source project</strong><br>

The truth is, there is no real open source project out there that is done for a beginner. Most projects are complete, solving a particular problem and are designed to be robust, secure and flexible.<br>

That just means more code, more structure, more decoupling which is an outright complexity for a beginner. A beginner thinks all code should be in one file so that you figure it out once.<br>

Contributing by adding even a small feature to a project requires you to understand how the whole project/library/plugin operates. It’s flow of logic. How it handles input/output. Otherwise every attempt will lead to screwing this one thing, then the other and then the whole thing comes down, landing on your little feet.<br>

Even my own jQuery AutoComplete plugin has proved a puzzle for most beginners wanting to contribute code to it. Yet it has well under 1000 lines of code.<br>

This is frustrating, if not annoying. The time you spend trying to establish the genius in the original coder by finding him out through his code would be better spent doing something else I am about to tell you.<br>

                            2. <strong>Your patch most likely won’t be accepted</strong><br>

Yes, I know, the talk is about “Contribute to open source projects on Github”. But they don’t tell you how.<br>

There are thousands of pending pull requests on projects on GitHub. Most githubbers are wary of newcomers wanting to add code to their codebase. I don’t know the proper reason, but your pull request just goes unattended to.<br>

                        <p><strong>The first year of college…....</strong><br>
A new beginning but I’m all broken because I had a dream of being in IIT but I was here, a tier 2 college. Trying to make myself stay strong and promising myself that history will not repeat again. This time I will be able to make my dreams alive. I had a dream again, similar to those dreams which IITians see, to be in a big company. I didn’t know the way to achieve it. <br>
My brain was ready to take the challenge and prepared itself for the long way. <br>
   
                            <strong>Prepare but what…..</strong> <br>
Trying to understand which things I should focus more on. I started exploring what exactly Tier-1 college students do. I realized focus should be more on coding skills and a mix of programming and development is required. So I started working on C programming. This was the time, I started feeling the taste of programming for the first time.<br>
I was confused where to start coding from. What should I do first? I just knew basic of C. So I started communicating with a senior who was in Directi. He always kept me feel motivated. Sooner, he gave me a target to do 90 questions in a month on some coding platform. And, those consistent green ticks on coding platform was too addictive and challenging continuing with my passion for coding but sometimes when I got stuck in some of the questions and seeking for help. I realized nobody is there to help out, as there was no coding culture in our college. Nobody in our college was focussing on coding. I have seen many workshops on robotics. But never found anything related to coding that can solve my doubts. So, I started getting connected with coders on Facebook. This was a good step as I was getting some guidance from here. And, I was no more feeling alone to work on enhancing coding skills. I believe you need company and network of like-minded people and all of them having the same purpose or aim.<br>
 
                            <strong>Web Development also needs to be taken care of...</strong><br>
Some of my friends were doing Android projects. Some of them were learning python. Some of them were attending workshops. I didn’t know which type of projects I should be working on. As every second of my life counts. And I had very less time in my hands. Here comes my mentor for the rescue, he advised me to work on those projects such that for 20% of effort, you will get 80% results. And those projects which are valuable for a company which you will be joining after graduating. I liked his advice and he suggested me some of the projects based on crawling and working with backend APIs and frontend that can communicate with the backend.<br>

Sometimes the conversation with my mentor goes very life changing. I want to share one of that learning with all of you :)<br></p>

                        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.<br>

                            <strong>How Does Cloud Computing Work?</strong><br>

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A Cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.<br>

                            <strong>Where, and how do I start learning for AWS as a beginner (no hands-on experience)?</strong><br>

Well as you mentioned you are a beginner so go through below steps to get an overall understanding of CLOUD as well as AWS:<br>

1.First try to understand the basic workflow of cloud,to get that information I think YouTube is sufficient.<br><br>
2.Once you get the basic then the next step is to get information related to all top cloud vendors,thier offering, stability,regions,no. Of data centres,etc.<br><br>

3. Do sign up for aws console by giving all information along with your credit/debit card details. They will deduct INR 2 for verification of card and account.<br><br>

4.Now, login inside AWS Management Console and try to explore as much services as much you can.<br><br>

Note:Be careful during provisioning of any instances or services. I will recommend provision only free tier instances to avoid any extra cost.<br><br>

5. Explore the console and try to have deep understanding about each terms.<br><br>

6.Well after that you can go for AWS master classes which is available on YouTube and you can also have a look at FAQ available at AWS website.<br><br>

7. If you think you got a good understanding then go for aws certification examination which will create good job opportunities on cloud.Below is the URL:
