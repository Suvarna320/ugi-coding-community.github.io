                        <p>Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.<br>

Example Input <br>
-2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4<br>
Answer Would be<br>
4 -1 2 1<br>


Solution:<br><br>

                            <strong>Kadane’s Algorithm:</strong><br>
--------------------------
Initialize:<br>
    max_so_far = 0<br>
    max_ending_here = 0<br>

Loop for each element of the array<br>
  (a) max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]<br>
  (b) if(max_ending_here < 0) <br>
            max_ending_here = 0<br>
  (c) if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)<br>
            max_so_far = max_ending_here<br>
return max_so_far<br>
--------------------------<br><br>


                            <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
Simple idea of the Kadane’s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far.<br>


Lets take the example:<br>
{-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}<br>

max_so_far = max_ending_here = 0<br>

for i=0,  a[0] =  -2<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)<br>
Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0<br>

for i=1,  a[1] =  -3<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)<br>
Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0<br>

for i=2,  a[2] =  4<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (4)<br>
max_ending_here = 4<br>
max_so_far is updated to 4 because max_ending_here greater<br> 
than max_so_far which was 0 till now<br>

for i=3,  a[3] =  -1<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-1)<br>
max_ending_here = 3<br>

for i=4,  a[4] =  -2<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)<br>
max_ending_here = 1
<br>
for i=5,  a[5] =  1<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (1)<br>
max_ending_here = 2<br>

for i=6,  a[6] =  5<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (5)<br>
max_ending_here = 7<br>
max_so_far is updated to 7 because max_ending_here is<br> 
greater than max_so_far<br>

for i=7,  a[7] =  -3<br>
max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)<br>
max_ending_here = 4<br>

Tell me about yourself.<br>
Trapping Rain Water :Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.<br>

Print left view of a binary tree.<br>
Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.<br>
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 2:</strong><br><br>
Tell me about yourself.<br>
Find sum of n elements after kth smallest element in BST. Tree is very large, you are<br>
not allowed to traverse the tree.<br>
Discussion : Since the array traversal is not allowed so we need to do some preprocessing over the tree, something like storing sum of all its predecessor nodes.For finding kth smallest element, use order statistics approach:<br>

Given a sorted array which has been rotated n number of times. Find the value of n. It is similar to below post where you need to find only the pivot element. If you have the Index of pivot element, you can get the number of times the array is rotated.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 3:</strong><br><br>
Count ways to reach nth stair.<br>

It is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same -Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each.
Design recommendation engine.<br>

It’s like auto suggestion. I gave the trie approach. The interviewer seemed fine with this approach and asked me to write full code with time and space complexities. Implementation of Tries.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Round 4(Managerial Round – Over video call)</strong><br><br>

Tell me about yourself.<br>
Current work<br>
Which project you liked working the most.<br>
 Any case where you had conflict with your manager.<br>
 Any idea/technology suggested by you to your team which then got implemented and worked out.<br>
 Any case when you had to work out of your comfort zone.<br>
 The most critical feedback received from your manager/team members.<br>
 What do you do to enhance your technical knowledge apart from your project work.<br>
And many more.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 5(Final Round – Telephonic)</strong><br><br>
Initially I was asked questions about the work I had done, the projects I did and some managerial questions.<br>
Ques : Print all the non-repeating words out of two given sentences.<br>
Eg. Statement 1: I have a blue pen.<br>
Statement 2: I got a red pen.<br>
Output : have blue got red<br>
Discussion : I suggested the hashing approach. The interviewer asked to implement the same.<br>

                        <p>Well, who doesn’t know about Google? In all probability, you may have landed on this post because of the Google SEO and AdWords. One of the biggest players in its domain, it has offices in more than 40 countries across the globe and an internship in Google is one of the most prestigious internships for the college students all over the world.<br>

What are the types of internships available at Google and who are eligible to apply?<br>

Google offers Technical internships and Product Management internships to students pursuing graduate, postgraduate, and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science and other related fields. For graduates, normally, 3rd or 4th year students are selected. If you are from any other stream but have sound coding and algorithm knowledge, you have equal chances of getting selected.<br>

Google summer internships for MBA students are 10-12 weeks long and are offered in a range of functions across the company. Students who have completed 1st year of their MBA can apply.<br>

You need to apply early on (October to January being the most optimal period), as most of the summer internship positions at Google are filled before February.<br><br>

                            <strong>How to apply?</strong><br>

There are four major ways of applying:<br>

1. Online application: Internships – Google careers<br>
 Applying online on the Google internship portal. You will need your resume (in PDF) and transcript.<br>

2. Employee referral:<br>
 Ask someone in Google to refer you. You can find them on LinkedIn or Facebook. This will only get you past the resume screening process. After that, the procedure is same for everyone.<br>

3. Mailing the Google HR:<br>
 Find a previous googler (Xoogler) or a former intern and ask her to provide you the e-mail address of the HR. Mail the HR directly, clearly stating your purpose, with a well-crafted cover letter and resume.<br>

4. Google Summer of Code:<br>
 It’s not exactly an internship at Google; it’s a global program sponsored by Google where students work on the projects with open source organizations (previously selected by Google) independently under some mentorship. Students contact the mentor organizations they want to intern with and submit a project proposal. It’s a virtual aka work from home internship program.<br>
