                        <p>I have always been fascinated with entrepreneurship. It has been a long journey that has still not found its destination. My tryst with entrepreneurship started in college itself and since then I have been a part of multiple start-ups and have seen them growing and scaling from scratch. In this article I would like to summarize my journey with start-ups and all I have got to learn during the same.<br><br>

                            <strong>1.Working in a Start-up is not a 9-6 Job:</strong> It is an alternative way of life where you start seeing the world with a different lens where everything is a problem statement and your purpose in life is to become master at solving them. While working in start-ups, I learnt to take note of every situation that I am encountered with as a problem statement and work my way out of it as if I am solving a problem or a puzzle. This instilled in me a killer problem solving instinct with an ability to invent my way out of tough situation.<br><br>

                            <strong>2.Making things from scratch:</strong>  When you build something from scratch the passion while creating the same is immense, also the learning in this process is exponential. It pushed me out of my comfort zone like I had never imagined and transformed me into a different individual altogether. It taught me the importance of taking initiatives and helped me master the art of Meta learning (the art of learning new things).<br><br>

                            <strong>3.Wearing multiple hats:</strong> Within the last 6 years I have worn multiple hats right from technical architect, product manager, project manager to software developer and that is the beauty of working in start-ups, you have a myriad of opportunities with a non-linear and exponential path of growth and learning. It helped me have a deeper understanding of both the technology and business aspect of things. While wearing multiple hats, I automatically inherited two major qualities in the profession; time management and multitasking.<br><br>

                            <strong>4.Learn to be a leader:</strong> The difference between a leader and a boss is that while the former leads, the latter drives. While working in a start-up I acquired all the traits of a good leader, which is being empathetic with my fellow employees and helping them grow which in turn helped me grow as a person and as a leader.<br><br>

                            <strong>5.Working in Start-ups helped me network:</strong> Working in a start-up, I faced multiple situations where I was required to seek opinions from fellow entrepreneurs so as to get a quick and efficient shot at solving the problem statement with as minimal cost as possible. This not only helped me in opening up new avenues but also gave me a sense of community.<br>

Cheers!<br>

                        <p>Six years ago when the elite engineering club of India, the Indian Institute of Technology closed its doors to visually challenged youth Srikanth Bolla due to his disability, it forced him to apply to the top Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Now he is all set to finish his studies in Computer Science and Business Management, and started a computer-training centre for visually challenged students.<br>

In 2009, Bolla had completed his pre-university exam from a college in Hyderabad, he wanted to get into IIT, but no coaching institute gave him admission. Due to which he applied at the MIT where he was selected among 120 foreign students. He is the only Indian blind student selected for the MIT.<br>

Last year Bolla shared his dream with the staff of MIT of creating a centre for blind students in India where they can learn computer.<br>

First, he created a curriculum, he bought five computers, rented a building, hired a faculty member, and began 10-week computer classes. The centre now trains 30 blind high school students each year, but with more funding, he hopes to add more computers and more students.<br>

Bolla was quoted in MIT journal, where he said, “I want to dedicate my life to community and social service. I want a place in society where people look up to me as a role model and great leader”.<br>

Bolla had earlier fought with the Government for his right to study Science. In a country where nearly 2.21% of the population is physically disabled, India has many barriers in place that impede the development of disabled children.<br>

In August 28, 2006, when Dr APJ Abdul Kalam posed a question to students during a programme asking them, ‘What do you want to become in life?’. It was Bolla who raised his voice from the crowd and said, “I want to be the first visually challenged President of India”.<br>

Bolla was born blind to a family who earned their livings through farming. After his birth villagers in his family advised his mother and father to let him die. In India physically handicapped kids by birth are considered as curse and are let to die.<br>

But his parents focused on his education and through their support he began breaking down every barrier put in his path.<br>

Srikanth is the CEO of Hyderabad-based Bollant Industries, an organisation that employs uneducated and disabled employees to manufacture eco-friendly, disposable consumer packaging solutions, which is worth Rs 50 crores.<br>

He considers himself the luckiest man alive, not because he is now a millionaire, but because his uneducated parents, who earned Rs 20,000 a year, did not heed any of the ‘advice’ they received and raised him with love and affection.<br>
                       “They are the richest people I know,” says Srikanth. :)<br>
