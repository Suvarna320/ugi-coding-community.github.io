                            <strong>1) Learn to build Recommender Systems with Movielens Dataset</strong><br>
From Netflix to Hulu, the need to build an efficient movie recommender system has gain importance over time with increasing demand from modern consumers for customized content. One of the most popular dataset available on the web for beginners to learn building recommender systems is the Movielens Dataset which contains approximately 1,000,209 movie ratings of 3,900 movies made by 6,040 Movielens users. You can get started working with this dataset by building a world-cloud visualization of movie titles to build a movie recommender system.<br><br>

                            <strong>2) Predicting Wine Quality using Wine Quality Dataset</strong><br>
I love everything that’s old, — old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine. — Oliver Goldsmith<br>

It’s a known fact that older the wine, better the taste. However, there are several factors other than age that go into wine quality certification which include physiochemical tests like alcohol quantity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, determination of density, pH and more. The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines by exploring their various chemical properties. Wine quality dataset consists of 4898 observations with 11 independent and 1 dependent variable.<br><br>

                            <strong>3) Boston Housing Price Prediction ML Project</strong><br>
Boston House Prices Dataset consists of prices of houses across different places in Boston. The dataset also consists of information on areas of non-retail business (INDUS), crime rate (CRIM), age of people who own a house (AGE) and several other attributes (the dataset has a total of 14 attributes).Boston Housing dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this machine learning project is to predict the selling price of a new home by applying basic machine learning concepts on the housing prices data. This dataset is too small with 506 observations and is considered a good start for machine learning beginners to kick-start their hands-on practice on regression concepts.<br>

                            <strong>Interview Tips :</strong><br>
Don’t just jump into the solution. They judge your thought process. Start with the simplest solution and build up on that, optimize that.<br>
Know your resume. They asked a lot of questions about projects and internships that I mentioned in my resume. Make sure that you are able to describe whatever you have written on your resume.<br>
Think out loud. Make sure you handle all corner cases while answering coding questions.<br>
There were a total of three rounds. Each round was of 50 minutes. First, there was a coding round, followed by system design round and finally a HR round.<br>
Each round started with interviewer giving his/her introduction and what he/she is working on followed by detailed technical or HR interview and then 5-10 minutes for questions from the interviewee.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 1 :</strong><br>
Josephus problem.<br>
Interviewer wanted analytical solution.<br>
A simple problem based on DFS.<br>
Interviewer wanted proper code with all corner cases with proper function names etc.<br>
Finally, there was a discussion on various projects and internships that I mentioned in my resume.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 2 :</strong><br>
Design a game leaderboard displaying top rankers from different regions.<br>
Take reliability, availability and latency into account for system design questions.<br>
Discussion on choice of databases : SQL based vs NoSQL.<br>
Discussion on latency, availability and reliability (CAP theorem).br<>
Database design for the system.<br>
API design.<br>
What happens when you type an address on a web browser and hit enter. Followed by questions related to DNS like what it is and how it works etc. This was followed by a question about how would I design DNS.<br>
This was followed by discussion on projects that I mentioned in my resume.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 3 :</strong><br>
Discussion on various projects and internships that I mentioned in my resume.<br>
Discussion on scalability of work done during my internship.<br>
Discussion on some of the open source development I have been involved in.<br>
General HR questions.<br>
Discussion on work culture in Apple.<br>
