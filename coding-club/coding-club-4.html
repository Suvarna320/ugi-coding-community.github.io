                        <p>To better understand the uses of machine learning, consider some of the instances where machine learning is applied: the self-driving Google car, cyber fraud detection, online recommendation engines—like friend suggestions on Facebook, Netflix showcasing the movies and shows you might like, and “more items to consider” and “get yourself a little something” on Amazon—are all examples of applied machine learning.<br>

All these examples echo the vital role machine learning has begun to take in today’s data-rich world. Machines can aid in filtering useful pieces of information that help in major advancements, and we are already seeing how this technology is being implemented in a wide variety of industries.<br>

The process flow depicted here represents how machine learning works<br>

With the constant evolution of the field, there has been a subsequent rise in the uses, demands, and importance of machine learning. Big data has become quite a buzzword in the last few years; that’s in part due to increased sophistication of machine learning, which helps analyze those big chunks of big data. Machine learning has also changed the way data extraction, and interpretation is done by involving automatic sets of generic methods that have replaced traditional statistical techniques.<br><br>

                            <strong>Uses Of Machine Learning</strong><br><br>
To understand the concept of machine learning better, let’s consider some more examples: web search results, real-time ads on web pages and mobile devices, email spam filtering, network intrusion detection, and pattern and image recognition. All these are by-products of applying machine learning to analyze huge volumes of data.<br>

The McKinsey report states, “As ever more of the analog world gets digitized, our ability to learn from data by developing and testing algorithms will only become more important for what are now seen as traditional businesses.” <br>

                        <p>Attitude towards having a strong work ethic. Learning technology comes later.<br>

I too had a similar profile: private university, non-existent programming culture. But overcoming all said challenges, I got selected for GSoC at the end of my second year.<br><br>

                            <strong>What I recommend through my personal experiences is :</strong><br>

Getting used to working as a programmer: I knew programming before joining college, although the kind of programming I am doing right now is way different from what I had learnt in school. Due credits given to my school for making my fundamentals strong in OOPS as well as getting me used to working as a programmer. Not very hardcore stuff, I just felt that I had an upper hand over the students who weren’t familiar with programming because I had spent 2 years on learning basics vs the latter had only one semester of introduction towards programming in general.<br>

To the people who aren’t familiar with programming, don’t get scared reading the first point. I repeat, the kind of programming that got me through GSoC is way different from what I had learnt in school. <br>

It’s imperative to getting used to coding. Read about the 10,000 rule for mastering any skill.<br> 

In a nutshell, be comfortable in using a computer more than the amount your average family member uses.<br>

A short list of what you can do:<br><br>
                            <strong>For basics/catching up:</strong><br>
Attend all the lectures related to programming in your college. Don’t miss out on lab sessions where you get hands-on knowledge.<br>
Or else if you belong to the self-motivated bunch, try taking Harvard’s CS50 course.<br>
Once you get the hang of basics:<br><br>
                            <strong>If you come from a Windows background/have a Windows Laptop:</strong><br>
Install any flavor of Linux having a LTS (Long Term Support) tag. It’s not compulsory but in my experience it’s far easier and more productive to work on a Linux machine. Most open source communities that get selected for GSoC primarily use Linux themselves. Remember, work with the right tool. <br>
I use Gnome (Ubuntu) 14.04 LTS dual booted with Windows 10.<br><br>
                            <strong>Start building a strong foundation:</strong> <br>
I have read countless failure stories, that people spent months preparing for GSoC and still couldn’t clear it. I am not trivializing their effort but you can’t just walk out of the room, even if you exert a lot of force on one of it’s wall. Try working smart, or in that analogy use the door. <br>

                        <p>90 % of the students graduate from Tier 2 college. Yes, they are not IITian but they have a big dream too'. I ‘m one of them :)<br><br>

                            <strong>The first year of college…....</strong><br>
A new beginning but I’m all broken because I had a dream of being in IIT but I was here, a tier 2 college. Trying to make myself stay strong and promising myself that history will not repeat again. This time I will be able to make my dreams alive. I had a dream again, similar to those dreams which IITians see, to be in a big company. I didn’t know the way to achieve it.<br> 
My brain was ready to take the challenge and prepared itself for the long way.<br><br> 
   
                            <strong>Prepare but what….</strong><br> 
Trying to understand which things I should focus more on. I started exploring what exactly Tier-1 college students do. I realized focus should be more on coding skills and a mix of programming and development is required. So I started working on C programming. This was the time, I started feeling the taste of programming for the first time.<br>
I was confused where to start coding from. What should I do first? I just knew basic of C. So I started communicating with a senior who was in Directi. He always kept me feel motivated. Sooner, he gave me a target to do 90 questions in a month on some coding platform. And, those consistent green ticks on coding platform was too addictive and challenging continuing with my passion for coding but sometimes when I got stuck in some of the questions and seeking for help. I realized nobody is there to help out, as there was no coding culture in our college. Nobody in our college was focussing on coding. I have seen many workshops on robotics. But never found anything related to coding that can solve my doubts. So, I started getting connected with coders on Facebook. This was a good step as I was getting some guidance from here. And, I was no more feeling alone to work on enhancing coding skills. I believe you need company and network of like-minded people and all of them having the same purpose or aim.<br><br>
 
                            <strong>Web Development also needs to be taken care of...</strong><br>
Some of my friends were doing Android projects. Some of them were learning python. Some of them were attending workshops. I didn’t know which type of projects I should be working on. As every second of my life counts. And I had very less time in my hands. Here comes my mentor for the rescue, he advised me to work on those projects such that for 20% of effort, you will get 80% results. And those projects which are valuable for a company which you will be joining after graduating.<br>
