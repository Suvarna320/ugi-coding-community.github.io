                        <p><strong>Round 1:</strong><br> 
(multiple choice questions)<br>

1. Intersection of two linked list.<br>
2. There is a 2 d array. 0 signifies water and 1 signifies land. an island is connected 0s(in all 8 direction) and no 0 should be on the outer edge of two array. You have to count the bumber of such possible array.<br>

You have to solve both coding question to enter in 2nd round<br>

In round 2 interviewer were very cool and supporting. try to shake hand while entering and ask every detail of problem.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 2:</strong><br>
1. Explain yourself.<br>
2. A backtrack problem on sudoku.<br>
write full code on paper in any language. write failure case of your code.<br>
3. Discussion on projects.<br>
i had done a project on big data on frequent itemset.they were really interested in each and every detail of big data paradigm.<br>
4. Your strength and weakness and extra curricular interests,<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 3:</strong><br>
1. there is a 3 million character string. u have to print the count of occurrence of each node.
do not jump on to the question. wait for him to complete. i gave count sort pf O(n) solution but he was focusing on more optimized one.<br>

2. again he jump to my big data project. he gave me a real life scenario and asked to design it.<br>
you are giving the information of about 10,000 sites about their users and the product they had bought. you are a consultant. give a big data solution to find out the places where users had bought the jewellery in large amount. also give the name and details of users who had bought jewellery in large amount.<br>

he was quite impressed by my design. we discuss the design for about 30 minutes. then instantaneously they told me that i am selected for 3rd round.<br>

In my case, I actively started...<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 4: (HR round)</strong><br>

HR was very cool<br>
1. tell me about yourself.<br>
2. why Miscrosoft.<br>
3. tell any 4 of your favorite product of Miscrosoft<br>
4. tell 2 good and 2 bad points of Microsoft.<br>
5. Why you opt for your college.<br>
he was trying to check my planning skills to compare 2 entities.<br>
6. Why computer science.<br>
7. Tell any 1 social problem that bothers you the most.<br>
8. Suggest 3 solution to above problem as a technical guy.<br>
9. what is big data<br>
10. what will you do if your colleague is not working<br>
11. what if you are not agreed with your senior<br>

My tips is to stay cool and enjoy the interview. carefully tell your weakness. Don’t worry to ask questions from interviewer. Take proper use of the time. Big data helps me a lot in every round.focus on designing problems along with data structure.<br>

                        <p><strong>Round 1: Hacker Rank Round – 75 minutes</strong><br>
It was 2 hr coding round. Both the questions were on matrix.<br><br>
                            <strong>Question 1 :</strong> M x N matrix with cell value as either 0 or 1. A connection between two cells is possible if value of both cells is 1. You need to count the total no. of possible connections. – Plain & easy matrix question.<br>
                            <strong>Question 2 :</strong> Again M x N matrix. You have to count the total no. of cells which are either maximum or minimum or both in it’s row or column. Two different cells can have same value.  – Can be easily solved using hash.<br>
For better understanding : a)If a cell has min/max value in row as well as column it’ll be counted only one and not twice.<br>
b) assume value (3, 4) is 6 and (5, 6) is also 6 and both are min/max values in row/column, then it’ll be counted twice.<br>

For a brief on these questions – refer this.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 2: Coder Pad & Technical Interview – 1 hour</strong><br>

This is a coder pad round with an easy question – Find nth line of pascal’s triangle, which we need to solve in 20 minutes. Followed by 40 minutes technical interview.<br><br>

                            <strong>Technical Interview</strong> – Basic core java concepts (since I cod in java) – Stack, heap, what is JVM, JRE, JDK etc,<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 3: Coder Pad – 45 mins</strong><br>

This round has a medium level question. It is kind of easy but the interviewer was focussing more on designing and the data types used.<br><br>

                            <strong>Suggestions: Throughout the interview –</strong> be more vocal. Explain your solution, thoughts and get clarification if you have any queries.<br><br>

                            <strong>Round 4: Technical Interview – 1 hour 20 minutes<br></strong>

Tell me about yourself, Current company and current project.<br>

Questions on Garbage Collection. Implementation of HashMap (complete end to end). How to override hash method, equals method. String pool, immutability concepts. Inheritance concepts. Questions on Object class. Method overloading/overriding. Java OOP Concepts.<br>

Coding question: Find the running median.<br>

The two interviewers were very cool and I really had fun in answering and discussing the solutions with them.<br>

                            <strong>Tip:</strong> Be clear. Smile all the time and don’t be nervous. If you don’t know/not strong enough in any concept just inform them that. They will change the topic. As far as I understood, this round is very important because the two interviewers are hiring managers and it is important that you make a good impression & perform well in this round.<br>
