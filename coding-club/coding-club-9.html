                            <strong>1. Ignore the story</strong><br>
Most of the times it is the initial part of the question is where a panda has to impress the villagers for a ritual. Although we all like pandas, after a while, you just become indifferent to helping those imaginary friends and not read the backstory.<br><br>


                            <strong>2. Input and Output</strong><br>
This is true for easier questions. They are generally very simple and sometimes looking at the sample input and output makes the solution quite evident.<br><br>


    <strong>3. No-compile submits</strong><br> 
This is my favorite. You write the code. And you submit it. No compilation. No sample input testing. Nothing. Just submit it as soon as you write it. This requires confidence and efficacy in your coding abilities. This might not be the best strategy in the start but when you are just trying to improve your rating it can be a game changer. Also, you become stronger every time as start sniffing the corner cases with more speed and accuracy.<br><br>


    <strong>4. Typing speed </strong><br>
If you get a chance to look at Petr’s or Gennady’s screencast, do that. You will be amazed to look at their speed of writing the code. They simply turn thoughts into code like we can turn thoughts into words.<br>

                        <p><strong>How C++ works.</strong><br>
For example, among many others, here are two things I learnt:<br>
1. Appending to a string as str += str2 is far more optimal than str = str + str2, because the latter creates a new string and then replaces its version stored in str.<br>
2. Using "<br>
" in C++ is more efficient than using “endl” because the latter flushes the output<br><br>

                            <strong>Viewing others code/solution</strong> to a problem may, at times, teach you more than the problem itself has to offer. The different approaches people use, along with the way they implement the solution has a lot to offer!<br><br>

    <strong>Time management</strong>, to a certain extent. Most contests have 5–6 questions to offer with a time limit of 2 hours to attempt the questions. Choosing how much time to give to a particular question before giving up, or determining if this question can be solved in the remaining time, is something that I’ve learnt over time.<br><br>

    <strong>How to solve questions efficiently.</strong> It is easy to solve questions in n^2, n^3, 2^n, etc, but solving them efficiently and always striving to improve the complexity is something I’ve learnt from Competitive Programming.<br><br>

                            <strong>Implementation skills.</strong> I cannot stress this enough. A complete grasp over STL of C++, and how to convert what I have in mind to a working code is something I have learnt after solving hundreds of CP questions.<br><br>

    <strong>Analysing the complexities</strong> of the programs and determining how long it will take for the program to run. The me from 2 years ago would have said that the following code takes almost O(n^2) time to execute. But I know now that it takes O(nlogn) time. And this is again, a very basic example:<br>
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)<br>
{<br>
 for(int j=1;i*j<=n;j++)<br>
 {<br>
  //Something<br>
 }<br>
}<br>
