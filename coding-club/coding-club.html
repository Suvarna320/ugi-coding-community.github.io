                        <p>To get started I will be suggesting some steps to follow in this manner :<br>

                            âœ… <strong>Select a programming language:</strong> Computer programming is basically done as a collection of instructions (also called binary coding) written so that the computer follows. <br>

These instructions can be written in various "languages". There is also an easy way to organise instructions and text. Since the language used depends on the program type, please choose the language that is relevant to what you want to do. If you think that language does not suit what you want, you can change it to another language at any time. <br>

    âœ… <strong>Learn at an online courses and practice on coding websites :</strong> You can learn a lot about programming from courses that consist of paying a fee to acquire the actual degree online or participating in a wonderful free program. There are many wonderful websites present to start programming. <br>
1. Hackerrank: Where you can start from scrach. <br>
2. Codeforces: You can find lot of mathematical problems which you can start initial. <br>
3. Codechef: Best Indian website for coding. <br>
4. SpoJ<br>

    âœ… <strong>Start with nice books and tutorials on programming :</strong> Let's get the latest book on the programming language you want to learn. Reviews such as Amazon are useful to distinguish between useful books and not. Your book depends on your language choice so search it according to your language and you will easily find the pdf on Internet.<br> 

    âœ… <strong>Take Practicipation in online contests:</strong> It will help you to being consistent in coding and you can easily check your performance graph with time. <br>

    âœ… <strong>Networking:</strong> Keep in touch with coders and like minded people. It the best thing to make coders friend and talk in terms coding language :p<br>

    âœ… <strong>Continue programming and keep trying new things!</strong><br></p>

                        <p>TI would recommend to follow "The Pareto principle" (also known as the 80/20 rule). So will we will try to find what 20% effort we can do which may result in 80% as an output. <br>
Example of The Pareto principle:<br>
You may have seen a topper may take whole semester to get full marks, but for the same course and books the smart one will just start one night before and get 80% marks. I believe you may have observed this in your life many times [80/20 law].<br>

So based on my experience I would be recommending you below projects which are not just exicting enough but pretty relatable for an interview so that the interviewers is able to grasp easily what you did and makes the interview more interacting one.<br>
<br>
So today's time, just developer is not enough instead we must think:<br>
How do I become a full stack developer. What do I need to do ?<br>

For that I would recommend you these 5 out of which what matches your frequency :)<br>

âœ… 1. Android Music Player, interviewer will be able to relate what you did as soon as you name it and ask question.<br>
