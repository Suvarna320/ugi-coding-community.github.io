                        <p>Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps the team cope with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.<br>

There are many ways it can be set up and configured, but at my job, here's how we use it: when a new employee starts, he downloads all the files from Github, which is an online server we're all connected to. <br>

So he has his local version of the files, I have my local version, our boss has his local version, etc.<br>

When I make a change to some files, I go through the following process in the Terminal. (There are GUI clients for Git, but I prefer working on the command line.)<br>

                            > <strong>git pull</strong><br>

That pulls the latest changes down from github. If there are conflicts between those and my local ones, it tells me what they are, file-by-file, line-by-line, and I now have a chance to reconcile those differences.<br>

After editing the files or creating new ones, I run this command:<br>

                            > <strong>git add .</strong><br>

Which adds all of my local changes to git, so that git knows about them. The dot after add specifically means to add all the changes I've made, e.g. new files I've added to my local folder or changes I've made to existing files. If I want, I can add only specific files, e.g. <br>

                            > <strong>git add myNewFile.js</strong><br>

I now write a comment about the adds I just made.<br>

                            > <strong>git commit -m "Fixed a major bug which stopped reports from printing."</strong><br>

Finally, I upload my changes to the server.<br>

                            > <strong>git push</strong><br>

Now, when my colleagues do a ...<br>

                            > <strong>git pull</strong>
<br>
... they will get my changes, and they will be notified if any of them conflict with their local versions.<br>

There are all kinds of cool, useful commands for rolling back changes to a particular time or state. But probably the most useful thing about Git is branching. Let's say my team is working on code for an Asteroids game, and I get the idea for making spinning asteroids. This will involve making some major changes to the existing asteroids code, and I'm a little scared to do that. No worries, I can just make a branch.<br>

First of all, I'll check which branches exist:<br>
................
                            > <strong>git branch</strong><br>
master*<br>
................<br>

                        <p><strong>Why Gsoc</strong><br>
The GSoC experience is about building open source communities. By focusing on students, we are going to the source of all future open source efforts. The ultimate success of the GSoC program is thus measured by the quality of the student experience. Each organization and each mentor plays a crucial role in creating this experience through their project ideas, developer culture, and the guidance they provide. They are rewarded by new code and by adding skilled new developers to their ranks.<br><br>


                            <strong>Do you have a real interest in potential GSoC projects?</strong> As a GSoC mentor you will be taking ownership of a project idea and seeing it through the summer. If you are not excited about the project, mentoring will be more difficult. You are an integral part of the process from project proposal to delivery.<br><br>

                            <strong>Are you willing to dedicate significant time?</strong> While the time requirements for mentoring vary, you should seriously consider your prior mentoring experiences and your available time before committing to this role. If you really don’t want to mentor, or really won’t have a reasonable amount of time each week, then don’t offer.<br><br>

                            <strong>More About Gsoc</strong><br>
Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work on a three month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.<br>

Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together 14,762 student participants and over 24,000 mentors from 118 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced over 35 million lines of code for 651 open source organizations.<br><br>

                            <strong>Invitation from Google</strong><br>
We’re excited to keep the tradition going! <br>
Applications for interested open source project organizations open on January 15, 2019, and student applications open March 25.<br></p>

                        <p>There is a significant amount of difference in the coding questions on all these websites. The difference in terms of categories, contests, quality, difficulty and the reason behind them. Personally, I took a lot of time identifying the difference and choosing the ones which were convenient for me. You will also eventually try most of them to figure out the ones which meet your requirements. Let me help you on your journey.<br>

I will start with my personal favorite.<br>

Hackerearth: For a complete novice or someone with little experience in competitive programming hackerearth is a great place to start. Codemonk series is one of the best resources out there. Coding questions, categorized on the basis of data structures and algorithms, will assist you to master all the topics covered in competitive programming. Circuits and easy contests will take you one level up as they are a bit difficult albeit useful.<br>

Hackerrank: Provides the best interface for coding compared to all the other websites. Hackerrank also categorizes based on algorithms and data structures, but personally, the questions are not up to the mark compared to hackerearth. Some questions are even misplaced in a different category. However, week of code contests are exceptional. They will make you discuss the question with friends each day and improve. Most of the companies use hackerrank for shortlisting/hiring candidates for internships and jobs.<br>

Codeforces: Implementation questions, quick problem solving, tricky questions with strict time and space constraints, awesome coding community, best editorials. Don’t miss a contest here and you will see yourself grow as a competitive programmer.<br>
